# Welcome to Xenos Web Team!

Thank you for visiting our official GitHub Page. In the future, we will create several repositories that you can use as a means of learning to contribute in open source. Stay tune!

## Guidelines

We are open to anyone, from any level, to learn to contribute with us. For those of you who are just learning. You can use this repository to get started.

## Let's Get Started!

1. First, you have to get to know Git. Some basic functions like add, clone, commit, push etc. You can learn it through the internet. And also basic usage of Github like fork, create repositories etc.

2. Next, once you have your GitHub account, "Fork" this repository.

3. Make sure that the repository you forked is in your GitHub profile. Then you can open it, and do a "Clone" to your local device. 

Do this way `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/xenosweb.git`. (Don't forget to change <your-github-username> to your Username).

4. You need to make sure that your repository is linked to our repository. You can do this by:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/xenosweb-org/xenosweb.git`. and
`git pull upstream main`.
